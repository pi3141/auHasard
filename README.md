## [demo](https://pi3141.github.io/nomAléatoire.html)

auHasard is a random name picker from a student list, with the features I need :

* Self-contained html file, which works without internet connexion.
* The student list can be copy-pasted from Pronote.
* The drawn name can be remove from pool for the next draw.
